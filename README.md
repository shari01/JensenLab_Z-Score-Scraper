This Python script automates the extraction of Z-scores for biomarkers from the JensenLab Diseases database using Selenium. It navigates through search results, extracts relevant data (e.g., Z-scores for Cervical Cancer and Cancer), and handles pagination with retries for robust scraping. The results are saved in a CSV file for further analysis.
